# General Conduction Data

## What is Conduction?
Conduction is the process by which heat or electricity is directly transmitted through a substance when there is a difference in temperature or electrical potential, without movement of the material.

## Key Properties of Conduction
- **Thermal Conductivity**: The ability of a material to conduct heat.
- **Electrical Conductivity**: The ability of a material to conduct electricity.
- **Material Dependence**: Metals are generally good conductors, while non-metals are poor conductors.

## Examples of Conduction
1. Heat transfer through a metal rod when one end is heated.
2. Electrical current flowing through a copper wire.

## Applications of Conduction
- Heat exchangers in industrial processes.
- Electrical wiring in buildings and devices.
- Cooking utensils like pans and pots.

## Factors Affecting Conduction
- Material type (e.g., metal vs. insulator).
- Temperature gradient.
- Cross-sectional area and length of the material.

## Formula for Heat Conduction
Fourier's Law:
\[
q = -k \cdot A \cdot \frac{dT}{dx}
\]
Where:
- \( q \): Heat transfer rate (W)
- \( k \): Thermal conductivity (W/m·K)
- \( A \): Cross-sectional area (m²)
- \( \frac{dT}{dx} \): Temperature gradient (K/m)
